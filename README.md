# CroftCappture
"CroftCappture" is an experimental Android 5.1 application that allows crofters to independently collect geospatial multimedia evidence of their croft. It was developed for the exploration of the socio-technical issues surrounding the use of smartphone-based volunteered geographic information for land registration, in the context of the Scottish crofting community.

Further technical details and the complete study behind this application can be found in:
